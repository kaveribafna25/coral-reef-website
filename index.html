<h2 style="color: crimson;">PICKLEBALL</h2>
<p>Pickleball is a fun racket sport played on a small court with a net. It starts with an underhand serve diagonally across the court.
     The ball must bounce once on each side before players can volley it.
      Players cannot hit the ball in the non-volley zone near the net ("the kitchen"). Points are scored only by the serving side, 
     and games are typically played to 11 points, win by 2.
    The game combines elements of tennis, badminton, and ping-pong and is easy to learn for all ages.</p>
